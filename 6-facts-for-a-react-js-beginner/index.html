      <p><em>React is the tool of choice for many web developers who build front-end web interfaces. Dubbed as the premium way to build rich experiences on the browser, many front-end developers have come to embrace it. In spite of its popularity, React has many well-kept secrets newcomers might not know and seasoned veterans may not have yet realized.</em></p>
<h2 id="1-react-is-not-a-framework">#1 React is not a framework</h2>
<p>Even professional React developers often say that React is a JavaScript framework. However, React’s official website describes it as “a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,” so who’s right? The short answer is that React is a JavaScript library, but the fact remains that it has several characteristics of a framework.</p>
<p>It’s just a library for rendering your views. If you’re coming from the MVC world, you need to realise that React is just the ‘V’, part of the equation, and you need to look elsewhere when it comes to defining your ‘M’ and ‘C’, otherwise you’re going to end up with some really yucky React code. More on that later.</p>
<p>All libraries are really just collections of class definitions, and when you call a method from a library, you remain in control. On the other hand, frameworks specify the control flow so they actually call your code. In a certain way, frameworks are meant to solve structural and architectural problems, which is not what React does. Instead, React simply provides methods that help web developers better handle front-end development.</p>
<h2 id="2-react-has-a-strong-community">#2 React has a strong community</h2>
<p>Developers love React, and it shows in how strong the community around it is. React’s official website lists multiple thriving React communities, each with thousands of users who are happy to share their experience, give useful tips, and answer code-level questions.</p>
<p>There’s also a massive amount of free or extremely affordable React resources on sites like YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, and others.</p>
<p>Because React is based on JavaScript, one of the most approachable programming languages in the world, you can be sure that the community around it is nothing but friendly and welcoming. With no elitism to spoil the mood, React beginners are not afraid to ask questions, which is exactly how it should be.</p>
