_Before the rise of React.js and Vue.js, creating large and maintainable web applications was quite a challenge. To name but a few reasons, JavaScript’s files were difficult to organize and deploy to production._

This has undoubtedly opened the doors to new developments. The best proof is that, while there were only 4 JS frameworks in 2016, this number increased to 10 by 2021 (State of JS, 2021).

And while React and Vue have turned frontend developers into productivity stars, a whole new perspective was proposed by the creator of Svelte.js.

In this article, let’s take a deeper look at:

- what Svelte and SvelteKit are
- why Svelte is getting popular
- what its best features are
- what the pros and cons are from the developer’s perspective

## What is Svelte?

Before we start, you might want to check this article about what Jamstack is, if you wish to know more about the headless approach. But now, let’s begin with the basics.

Like React and Vue, Svelte is a JavaScript framework/library. In general, it’s a set of components, tools and rules for creating the structure of websites and applications with the use of JavaScript. Svelte, however, has developed its own, original way to let developers build what they need and want. Due to this fresh approach, Svelte is sometimes described as a compiler.

React and Vue use a virtual DOM in the browser, which leads to certain performance shortcomings. The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface for web pages. It is an API that allows programs to read and manipulate the page content, structure and styles. You can compare it to temporary memory storage for interface changes.

Svelte, however, doesn’t use a virtual DOM, instead compiling code into tiny, pure Vanilla JS. As a result, the code works much faster from the beginning, making a potential app product much lighter and user-friendly. This is the first and most notable difference that Svelte has presented to the world of coding.
